// is used for comments in C++
#include <iostream>

// # is used for preprocessor statement
// "include" finds files, take all content in that and place in curent file (simply)

int main()
//ever program has a main function. This is the entry point to every code.
{
    std::cout<<"Hello World!"<<std::endl;
    //every statement in c++ ends with ";"
    // code is executed in order, except for control flow statements

    // main function even  though data type is int, no return is required.
